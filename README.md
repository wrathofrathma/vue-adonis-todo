# Overview

Vue 3.0 + Primevue + Adonisjs CRUD TODO based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEZlcPvez8 

# Primary Differences
There are a few key differences between this app and the tutorial video this is based on.
- Adonis.js structure has changed since the video release
- Vue.js has been updated to Vue 3.
- Due to the update of Vue, we're also using a different component library. We're using Primevue instead of Vuetify.
